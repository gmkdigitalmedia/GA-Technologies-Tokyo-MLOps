# GP MLOps Platform - Technical Demo

## What This Actually Does

**Real MLOps platform demonstrating:**
- Customer value prediction using actual ML models
- Floorplan image analysis with computer vision
- A/B testing framework for ad optimization
- Real-time model serving with KServe
- Integration with Snowflake data warehouse
- AWS cloud infrastructure deployment

## Technical Components

### Core ML Models
- **Customer Inference**: Scikit-learn models for conversion probability
- **Floorplan Detection**: PyTorch CNN for room layout analysis
- **Property Recommendation**: Collaborative filtering system

### Infrastructure
- **KServe**: Model serving with auto-scaling
- **Snowflake**: Data warehouse integration
- **AWS**: S3, SageMaker, ECS deployment
- **PostgreSQL**: Application database
- **Redis**: Caching layer

### APIs
- Customer value prediction endpoints
- Floorplan image upload and analysis
- Ad serving with targeting logic
- Conversion tracking and attribution

## What You Can Actually Demo

1. **Upload a floorplan image** → Get room detection results
2. **Input customer profile** → Get conversion probability prediction  
3. **Create ad campaigns** → See A/B testing framework
4. **View model performance** → Real accuracy metrics
5. **Check system health** → Actual uptime and response times

No fake revenue numbers, no made-up ROI claims.
Just real technology doing real ML tasks.
